# Trademark

Fleek LLC originally conceived the Plug and is in charge of distributing its open source code and interfaces. The Plug extension is fully open source; however, this does not provide access to the Plug brand and image trademarks/licenses.

We take the usage of our brand and service trademarks very seriously, as it is our responsibility to ensure all Plug users whether Fleek LLC is the entity behind a service or website; and that the resources, platforms, services, and open source code/software that is shared represents unmodified Plug software.

These trademark policies affect the Plug brand, and associated image, logos, websites, and content. **Want to ask for permission to utilize our branding, or report a misuse? Contact us at yo@plugwallet.ooo**
