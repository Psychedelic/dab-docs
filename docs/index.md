## 🎨 V0.1.0 - The NFT List

![](https://storageapi.fleek.co/nicopoggi-team-bucket/dab-gh-nft.png)

In its first iteration, we have released DAB's first registry, **the NFT list** DAB provides a list of NFTs that apps & developers can **consume to easily surface a user's NFTs from multiple collections, as they are listed in DAB, instead of supporting them one by one**.

> Want to submit an NFT collection so its listed in DAB for apps to auto-surface? See below!

DAB's NFT list is **standard agnostic** and through the DAB-js library, developers can easily integrate and make calls to any NFT collection on the list regardless of their NFT standard interface (EXT, Departure Labs, etc.), **because in its library DAB wraps all standards into a common javascript interface**.

### 🧰 Getting Started with DAB - NFT List

Want to connect your app to **DAB's NFT list** to auto-surface a user's NFT collections and easily integrate multiple assets and standards at once in your UI/app?

To interact with DAB's services you need to use the DAB-js library. Read our documentation or visit the DAB-js repository to get started.
