# Welcome to DAB 👋

Welcome to DAB's documentation. DAB is an open internet service for data on the IC. All the data an IC app needs to make a seamless experience, accessible directly on the IC. DAB is an open internet service for NFT, Token, Canister, and Dapp registries.

!!! Important

    DAB is currently in its V0.1.0. This version includes the NFT list/registry only. The Token, Canister, and Dapp list services will follow soon after, but early applications for these lists are still being collected (find the forms in the menu)

## 🎨 V0.1.0 - The NFT List

![](https://storageapi.fleek.co/nicopoggi-team-bucket/dab-gh-nft.png)

In its first iteration, we have released DAB's first registry, **the NFT list** DAB provides a list of NFTs that apps & developers can **consume to easily surface a user's NFTs from multiple collections, as they are listed in DAB, instead of supporting them one by one**.

> Want to submit an NFT collection so its listed in DAB for apps to auto-surface? See below!

DAB's NFT list is **standard agnostic** and through the DAB-js library, developers can easily integrate and make calls to any NFT collection on the list regardless of their NFT standard interface (EXT, Departure Labs, etc.), **because in its library DAB wraps all standards into a common javascript interface**.

### 🧰 Getting Started with DAB - NFT List

Want to connect your app to **DAB's NFT list** to auto-surface a user's NFT collections and easily integrate multiple assets and standards at once in your UI/app?

To interact with DAB's services you need to use the DAB-js library. Read our documentation or visit the DAB-js repository to get started.
