# üñåÔ∏è Getting Started - Integrate the Canister List

![](https://storageapi.fleek.co/fleek-team-bucket/canregistry.png)

Ready to integrate the Canister List to surface metadata for Canister IDs in your UI/App? All right!

Just like using the NFT List, you will need to use the **[DAB-js library](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DAB-js/)**, which we built to provide a simple plug-n-play way of integrating **all of DAB's registries**. With it, you will:

1. Query DAB's Canister Registry to check if a Canister ID has associated metadata.
2. Receive a metadata object you can surface in the UI.

**Remember**, with DAB, you will check if the Canister ID you're querying has associated metadata; if the canister's controller hasn't added the Canister ID and its metadata to the Canister List yet, it won't return information. [Canister controllers can submit new canisters here](https://dab-ooo.typeform.com/canister-list)

## 0. ‚öôÔ∏è Preparing your environment

To pull and install from [@Psychedelic](https://github.com/psychedelic) via the NPM CLI, you'll need:

- A Github account
- A Github personal access token (you can create a personal acess token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
- The personal access token with the correct scopes, **repo** and **read:packages** to be granted access to the [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).
- Authentication via `npm login`, using your Github email for the **username** and the **personal access token** as your **password**:

Once you have those ready, run:

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Psychedelic
```

> **Note:** You only need to configure this once to install the package!
    On npm login provide your Github email as your username and the Personal access token as the password.

You can also setup your npm global settings to fetch from the Github registry everytime it finds a **@Psychdelic** package, find the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-your-registry-settings-as-an-npm-enterprise-user).

‚ö†Ô∏è Alternatively, a token could be passed to the `.npmrc` as `//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=xxxxxx` but we'd like to keep it clean and tokenless.

## 1. üß∞ Setting up DAB-js in your project

First, you need to install the DAB-js **npm package** into your project.

You can do so from the command line
```js
npm install @psychedelic/dab-js@latest
```

Find more details about installing versions in the package page [here](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DAB-js/packages/987540)

## 2. üõ¢Ô∏è Check a Single Canister's Metadata in the Registry (getcanisterInfo)

This method allows you to query the DAB canister registry to fetch the metadata for a **specific Canister ID**. You will need to pass:

- `canisterID`: the Canister ID of the canister you want to check in DAB.
- `agent`: and HttpAgent (instantiated with agent-js or Plug)


```ts
import { getCanisterInfo } from '@psychedelic/dab-js';
const agent = new HttpAgent();
const nnsCanisterId = 'ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai';
const nnsMetadata = await getCanisterInfo(nnsCanisterId, agent);
console.log(nnsMetadata);
```

If the Canister ID has metadata associated in the Canister Registry, it will return a **metadata object**. Else, it will return undefined.

```js
type CanisterId = Principal | string;
interface CanisterMetadata {
  url: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  version: number;
  logo_url: string;
}
```


## 3. üõ¢Ô∏èüõ¢Ô∏è Check Multiple Canister's Metadata in the Registry (getMultipleCanisterInfo)

This second method is a variation that allows you to query DAB to check the metadata of **multiple canisters at once**. The main differences is that you will pass:

- `canisterIDs`: An array of **several canister IDs** of the canisters you want to check in DAB.
- `agent`: and HttpAgent (instantiated with agent-js or Plug).

```ts
import { getMultipleCanisterInfo } from '@psychedelic/dab-js';

const agent = HttpAgent();
const canisterIds = ['e3izy-jiaaa-aaaah-qacbq-cai', 'qcg3w-tyaaa-aaaah-qakea-cai']; // Cronic + ICPunks
const nftsInfo = await getMultipleCanisterInfoFromDab(canisterIds, agent);
console.log(nftsInfo);
```


In contrast to the previous method, this will return an **array of metadata objects** for all the canister IDs you entered.
